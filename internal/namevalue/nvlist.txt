zfs nvlist on disk format

it is most convenient to talk about offsets in hex

A ZFS vdev label looks as follows:

0    - 8k    blank space
8k   - 16k   reserved boot header
16k  - 128k  name/value pairs
128k -       zfs stuff -- relevant to this.

The portion we're interested in is the 16k - 128k region of name/value pairs.

The offsets of this section is 0x4000 - 0x20000 for a total of 0x1c000 bytes.
